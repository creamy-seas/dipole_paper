\begin{abstract}
  \noindent Short decoherence time limits one of the main obstacles hindering industrial scale implementation of quantum processors based on macroscopic superconducting qubits.
  In this work we investigate a qubit with new type of twin geometry - a fusion of two flux qubits joined by a common Josephson Junction. This kind of twin qubit is measured to have energy spectrum plateaus at the degeneracy flux bias point, $ \Phi \sim \frac{1}{2}\Phi_0 $ - the shallowness of the plateaus exceeds that of previous flux qubits by orders of magnitude.

  % The qubit has a also unique dipole controllable coupling to the environment.

  The qubit is fabricated using standard technology and is measured to have a decoherence time of 42\,ns. We demonstrate the transmission spectrum, Rabi oscillations and simulate the dipole transition on this new type of qubit.
