\section{Introduction}
% A quantum electronic platform that  parallels the functionality of a transistor
% \cite{Astafiev2010}\cite{hoi2011}, multiplexer \cite{honigl2018} and serial bus
% \cite{shen2005}  will  server as  an  intergral  part of  commercialisation  of
% quantum  computing power.   Superconducting quibts  are one  of the  device sof
% choice

Superconducting  qubits are  one of  the promising  traods for  implementation of
quantum computing  technololgy. Being nothing more  than strips of aluminum  on a
chip,  their geometry  can  be  designed to  select  an  operating energy,  state
transition rates  and sensitivity that  would fit  the use-case of  very specific
environments.

\noindent Over the past decade they have  been carried out the functionality of a
transistor  \cite{Astafiev2010}\cite{hoi2011}, multiplexer  \cite{honigl2018} and
serial bus \cite{shen2005}.
% Being nothing more than strips of aluminum on a chip,
their geometry  can be designed to  select an operating energy,  state transition
rates   and  sensitivity   that  would   fit  the   use-case  of   very  specific
environments. They can then be  mass produced using industry standard fabrication
techniques   and    integrated   at   scale   into    large   coherent   circuits
\cite{johnson2010}.  This  all speaks  to their strong  case of  servicing future
quantum electronic platforms.


One  of the  inherent limitations  superconducting  qubits still  face are  their
comparatively  short coherence  times,  $\tau_{\text{dec}}$.  Over  this period  the
$\rho_{01}$   and   $\rho_{10}$   components    of   the   system's   density   matrix,
$\rho  =   \ensuremath{\left(\begin{smallmatrix}  \rho_{00}   &  \rho_{01}  \\   \rho_{10}  &
      \rho_{11}  \end{smallmatrix}\right)}  $,  decay   to  zero  and  computational
information becomes  lost \cite{phaseExp}.  For  example, the transmon  qubits in
the      revolutionary     5-qubit      quantum      experience     from      IBM
(\href{http://www.research.ibm.com/ibm-q}{research.ibm.com/ibm-q})     have     a
coherence time of $ \sim 60\,\mu $s \cite{linke2017}. In contrast, 20 years ago qubits
on trapped  $ ^{+} $Be$  ^{9} $ ions  already had a  coherence time of  $\sim1\, $ms
\cite{monroe1995}.   Such  strong  decoherence  in superconducting  qubits  is  a
consequence of the large capacitances of their macroscopic sized structures (loop
features   can   often   be   $    1\iunitMixed{\mu}{m}$   or   greater   in   size
\cite{Astafiev2010}\cite{hoi2011}\cite{johnson2010}), coupling strongly to charge
variations  in the  external  environment.  This  fluctuates  the qubit's  energy
levels, leading to an erratic evolution  of the quantum state that `averages' out
information  on  the  off-diagonal   elements  \cite{devoret2008}.   To  house  a
sufficient  number  of  quantum  logic operations  for  multi-stage  computations
($  10^4   $)  coherence   times  need   to  surpass   the  $   100\,\mu$s  barrier
\cite{orlando1999}.
 
Flux qubit  architectures were developed  to address this decoherence  problem by
making the energy of their Josephson junctions (JJ) dominant in the system, which
lowered  the device's  charge sensitivity  purely  by nature  of suppressing  the
relative     size      of     any     charge-related      energy     fluctuations
\cite{orlando1999}\cite{chiorescu2003}\cite{mooij1999}.  The further branching of
flux  qubit   designs  has   lead  to   improved  coherence   times:  quantronium
$\sim500\,$ns     \cite{cottet2002}    \cite{gu2017},     shunted    phase     qubit
$\sim10\,\mu $s \cite{stern2014} , shunted  flux qubit $\sim80\,\mu$s \cite{yan2016} , 4-JJ
\cite{qui2016}, fluxonium $\sim1\,$ms \cite{pop2014}.
 
This list  is extended with  a `twin' qubit,  consisting of two  symmetrical flux
qubits, linked  by a common $  \alpha-$JJ (Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}).  A chain  of 15 such
qubits was recently placed into  a coplanar waveguide to demonstrate flux-tunable
transmission of  microwaves \cite{shulga2018}. Of  particular interest to  us was
the weak flux dependence  of the chain's transition energy when  it was biased to
the degeneracy  point $\frac{1}{2}\Phi_0 $  pointing to an operational  regime which
would benefit from both low flux and charge sensitivities.
 
In  this work  we  isolate one  of  these twin  qubits  and provide  experimental
evidence  for:   strong  anharmonicity  of   the  system  with  respect   to  the
\iket{1}\ilra\iket{2} and \iket{2}\ilra\iket{3} transitions; weak flux dependence
of      the     transition      energies     at      the     degeneracy      bias
$\sim    \frac{1}{2}\Phi_0     =    \frac{h}{4e}$,    with    a     decoherence    rate
$    \tau_\text{decoherence}   =    42\,    \text{ns}   $;    simulation   of    the
\iket{1}~\ilra~\iket{2} transition rate.

The goal  of the  experiment is  to study the  energy structure,  compliance with
simulations and check controllability.
