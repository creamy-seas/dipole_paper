\section{Conclusion}
\noindent We  have fabricated  and characterized  the first
isolated twin  qubit, the distinguishing features  of which
are  the weak  flux sensitivity  and allowed  \iket{1}\ilra
\iket{2}      transitions     at      degeneracy     points
$ \Phi = (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_0, n\in\mathbb{Z} $, compared to other
flux qubit geometries.  Improved fabrication techniques can
further advance the qubit's decoherence time to place it in
competition  of  serving  as  enhanced  building  block  in
quantum electronic circuits.
