\section{Operations with qubits}
\label{sec:characterisation}

% \red{Need scattering data}

\noindent We record the energy spectrum of  the twin qubit while sweeping the biasing magnetic
flux.  Because of a  small asymmetry, $\eta$, the fluxes linked through the  left and right loops
are $ \Phi = \frac{\varphi}{2\pi}\Phi_0$ and $ \eta\Phi $.

The  \iket{1}~\ilra~\iket{2} transition,  $\omega_{21}$, is  mapped with  a network  analyzer which
measures the transmission  of signal $\omega_{\text{NA}}$ through the system.   Away from resonance
the  signal  passes  through the  circuit  without  any  interaction  with the  qubit.   After
correcting  for  line losses,  transmission  is  close to  $  100\%  $.  Only  near  resonance
($\omega_{\text{NA}}=\omega_{21}$), does the qubit exchange photons with the driving field as it evolves
between the ground and excited states \cite{rabi}.  The  qubit emits a wave that is exactly in
anti-phase with the driving field \cite{abdumalikov2010}, and the destructive superposition in
the output line  results in a transmission dip, see  Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission}. The trace of
blue circles, marking this  transmission dip at different magnetic flux,  maps out the qubit's
$\omega_{21}$ transition spectrum, see inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{\small \textbf{Mapping  the qubit transition  spectrum:}  For the  lower transition
    $\omega_{21}$ (blue,  inset) a  network analyzer measures  the power  transmission coefficient,
    \iabsSquared{t}, at flux  bias $ \Phi $  and microwave frequency $  \omega_{21}/2\pi$.  A Lorentzian
    fit \cite{Astafiev2010}  to the transmission  profile establishes the  resonant frequency,
    which  is  marked  with  blue  points on  the  flux-frequency  spectrum.   For  transition
    $\omega_{32}$  (red, inset)  a two-tone  measurement is  run by  monitoring changes  to a  weak
    $\omega_{21}$ probe while sweeping a second frequency  in search of the higher transition.
    % Any changes to the probe's transmission are indicative of hitting the higher transition, which
    % is marked with a red point on the spectrum.
    % Readings are taken about the degeneracy point
    % $  \Phi \sim  \Phi_{0}/2 $,  where the  low  curvature of  transition energies,  allows for  stable
    % measurements with respect to fluctuations in the field.

The \iket{2}\ilra\iket{3}  transition, $\omega_{32}$, is  mapped using two-tone  spectroscopy.  The
network  analyzer is  tuned to  the transition  frequency  $ \omega_{21}  $, taken  from the  first
measurement  and called  the  probe signal,  while  an additional  generator  sweeps a  second
frequency,  $  \omega_{\text{GEN}} $.   Whenever  the  generator strikes  the  \iket{2}\ira\iket{3}
transition ($\omega_{\text{GEN}} = \omega_{32} $), the qubit undergoes a ladder of excitations, \iket{1}
\iratext{$\omega_{21}$}\iket{2}  \iratext{$\omega_{32}$}  \iket{3},  depopulating  states  \iket{1}  and
\iket{2}.  Because of  this depopulation, the probe signal becomes  less involved with driving
and it's transmission moves out of  the transmission dip in Fig.~\ref{fig:transmission}.  This
identifies $\omega_{32}$ which  is mapped with red circles in  the transition energy-magnetic field
spectrum.

We  match the  experimental  data points  to  simulations made  on  the standard  Hamiltonian,
$  \mathcal{H}   =  T   +  U   $  \cite{orlando1999}.    Islands,  isolated   by  the   JJ  in
Fig.~\ref{fig:setup},     are     labeled     with     Cooper     pair     (CP)     occupation
$         \vec{n}        =         \iket{n_1,        n_2,         n_3}        $,         phase
$       \vec{\varphi}       =       \iket{\varphi_1,       \varphi_2,       \varphi_3}       $       and       voltage
$ \vec{V} = \iket{V_{1}, V_{2}, V_{3}} $ states.   The charges and voltages on the islands are
linked by the capacitance matrix
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:link}
  2e\vec{n} = \hat{C}\vec{V}.
\end{equation}

\noindent The capacitance matrix in the twin qubit topology is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:capac}
  \hat{C} = \iabs{C} \begin{pmatrix}
    2  &  -1  &  0\\
    -1  &  2  +  \alpha  &  -1\\
    0  &  -1  & 2
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}

\noindent where  \iabs{C} is the capacitance  of the outer  JJs.  The interaction of  the CPs,
carrying a charge $  \vec{Q}=2e\vec{n} $, and voltages on their  respective islands gives rise
to the `kinetic' term of the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:kinetic}
  \begin{aligned}
    T = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{3}Q_iV_i & =
    \frac{(2e)^2}{2}\vec{n}\hat{C}^{-1}\vec{n}^{T}\\
    & = E_C \iabs{C} \iaverage{\hat{C}^{-1}}_{\iket{n_{1}, n_2, n_3}},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent where we define $ E_{C}={(2e)^{2}}/{2 \iabs{C} } $.

Each  JJ  with   a  phase  difference  of  $\Delta\varphi_{i}$,  contributes   a  `potential'  energy  of
$ E_{Ji}\left(1 - \cos(\Delta\varphi_i)\right) $.  The flux quantization condition for the left and right
loops,  $  \sum_{i}^{\text{loop}} \varphi_i  =  2\pi  n,  n \in  \mathbb{Z}$,  enters  as a  dependence  on
$ \varphi_\text{ext} $ and $ \eta\varphi_\text{ext} $ on two of the junctions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:potential}
  \begin{aligned}
    U & = E_J\big[4 + \alpha - \alpha\cos(\varphi_{2}) -\cos(\varphi_{1}) -\cos(\varphi_{3}) - \\
    & \qquad \cos(\varphi_{2} - \varphi_{1} - \varphi_{\text{ext}}) - \cos(\varphi_{2} - \varphi_{3} + \eta\varphi_{\text{ext}})\big].
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The Hamiltonian is solved in the CP-basis,  $\vec{n} $, where it's matrix representation takes
the form shown  in Fig.~\ref{fig:matrix_representation}.  The basis consists  of elements such
as \iket{-1, 0, 1}, representing the CP occupation  of the three islands.  In the matrix shown
each island can have an  occupation $ -1 \le n_{i} \le 1$ (3 CP states),  for a total of 27 system
states.  In  the simulation, this was  increased to 343 by  using 7 CP states.   Kinetic terms
($ {T}  $) naturally fall on  the diagonal axis  of the matrix.   Potential terms ($ U  $) are
expanded   to    complex   exponentials,   which    become   off   diagonal    elements   (see
Appendix~\ref{sec:expans-potent-term}).
% For            example             $            \cos(\varphi_{2})             $            becomes
% $    \mathbb{I}_{1}\otimes\frac{1}{2}\left[\sum_{n_2}\iketbra{n_2+1}{n_2}   +    \iketbra{n_2-1}{n_2}
% \right]\otimes\mathbb{I}_{3} $, where identity operators $  \mathbb{I}_{1,3} $ carry the states of
% the non-involved islands.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering \includegraphics[height=5cm]{fig4}
  \caption{\small \textbf{Hamiltonian in the CP-basis representation:} Purple square denote the kinetic terms that all fall on the main diagonal. Light blue squares denote simple off-diagonal terms distributed symmetrically about the main diagonal, arising from e.g. $\cos(\varphi_2)$. Dark blue squares are have an additional flux dependence $e^{i\varphi_{\text{ext}}}, e^{i\eta\varphi_{\text{ext}}}$, arising from e.g. $\cos(\varphi_2-\varphi_1-\varphi_{\text{ext}})$.
    \label{fig:matrix_representation} }
\end{figure}

\noindent The  eigenenergies of the resulting  Hamiltonian are compared with  the experimental
data in  Fig.~\ref{fig:experiment} using  \iunit{E_J =  91.0}{GHz}, \iunit{E_C  = 13.50}{GHz},
\iunit{\alpha = 1.023}{}, \iunit{\eta = 1.011}{}.  Readings for  $ \omega_{32} $ are in a narrow flux range
because  away  from $  \Phi  =  n  \Phi_0,  n\in\mathbb{Z} $,  it  gets  harder  to  tune the  VNA  to
$  \omega_{21} $  (as part  of the  two-tone spectroscopy  procedure) which  prevents the  accurate
mapping of  $ \omega_{32} $  with the second  tone.  The asymmetry  value, $ \eta  $, is close  to the
visual loop  area difference  of 3\%  seen from  the SEM  image in  Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}.  The
resonance is  periodic in flux,  with a  tendency of higher  $\omega_{21}$ at higher  magnetic flux
numbers.

  \caption{\small \textbf{Experimental spectra,  circles, and simulation, solid  lines, of the
      twin   qubit:}  Shown   are  the   transition  frequencies   $  \omega_{21}   $  (blue)   and
    $ \omega_{32}$ (red).   Asymmetry in the flux  penetrating the left and right  loops results in
    the gradual change of transition frequencies with  every $ \Phi_{0} $ period: $\omega_{21}$ creeps
    up,   while   $\omega_{32}$   creeps   down,   breaking   the   usual   periodicity   of   flux
    qubits.  \label{fig:experiment}}

An important qubit parameter is the curvature at the turning points in the energy spectrum, at
the operation  point of  the qubit.   A low  curvature is  desirable, to  make the  qubit less
sensitive to external flux changes, which would improve decoherence time.  At the twin qubits'
degeneracy    points    $     \Phi    =    n\Phi_0,    n\in\mathbb{Z}    $,     the    curvature    is
$   -550\pm10\,\text{GHz}/\Phi_0^2  $.    It  is   substantially   smaller  than   $  13\times   10^4$
$ \text{GHz}/\Phi_0^2$ on the 4-JJ flux qubit  \cite{stern2014}, $ 8.4 \times 10^4$ \cite{zhu2010} and
$ 37\times 10^{4}$  $ \text{GHz}/\Phi_0^2$ \cite{gustavsson2012} on the 3-JJ  flux qubits demonstrated
recently. However, the decoherence  time of $ = \iunit{42}{ns} $,  taken with Rabi oscillation
in Fig.~\ref{fig:rabi} \cite{Bylander2011,Ithier2005,Martinis2003},  was relatively short.  We
attribute  this  to poisoning  of  the  sample with  the  infrared  radiation, and  simplified
technology used for the qubit's fabrication.

      $ e^{-\Delta t/\tau_{\text{dec}}} $, of the the oscillations. \label{fig:rabi}}
