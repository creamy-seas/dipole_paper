\section{Dipole Transition}
\label{sec:dipole-transition}

\noindent  Finally we  characterize the  dipole moment  of transition  between the  lowest two
states,  \iket{1}   and  \iket{2}.   Microwaves   in  the  transmission  line,   with  voltage
$   V_{\text{mw}}=   \iabs{V_{\text{mw}}}\cos(\omega_{21   }t)   $  are   coupled   via   capacitor
C$_{\text{coupling}}$  to   the  qubit.   On   island  2   the  microwaves  induce   a  charge
$ Q_{2}=C_{\text{coupling}}V_{\text{mw}} $.  Transitions \iket{1}~\ilra~\iket{2} stimulated by
this driving  generate a qubit voltage  of $ \delta  V_2 = \ibra{1}\hat{V}_2\iket{2} $  between the
ground and  island 2 and  hence draw an  electrostatic energy related  to the strength  of the
drive $\Omega$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dipoleEnergy}
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta V_{2}Q_{2} & = \ibra{1}\hat{V}_2\iket{2} C_{\text{coupling}}\iabs{V_{\text{mw}}}\cos(\omega_{21}  t) \\
    & = \hbar\Omega\cos(\omega_{21}t).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent  Thus,   up  to  the   constant  of  proportionality   $  Q_{2}  $,   evaluation  of
$\delta     V_2     =\ibra{1}\frac{E_{C}}{2\iabs{e}(1+\alpha)}\left[\hat{n}_1     +     2\hat{n}_2     +
  \hat{n}_3\right]\iket{2}$} gives  the coupling strength  $\Omega$ between the microwave  line and
the qubit system.
% at different values of the magnetic field.

To  quantitatively compare  coupling  strength  between different  flux  qubit geometries,  we
re-write the voltage element through flux:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dipole_voltage_7}
  \begin{aligned}
    \ibra{1}\hat{V}_2 \iket{2} & =  \frac{d}{dt}\ibra{1}\hat{\Phi}_2\iket{2}\\
    & = \frac{d}{dt}\left[\left(e^{i\omega_{21}t/2}\ibra{1}\right) \hat{\Phi}_2\left(e^{+i\omega_{21}t/2}\iket{2}\right)\right]\\
    & = {i\omega_{21}\beta\Phi_0},
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent   where   we    have   used   the   free   evolution   of    a   two-level   system,
$                   U(t)=e^{-i                    \frac{\mathcal{H}}{\hbar}t}                   $,
$  \mathcal{H}  =   -\frac{\hbar\omega_{21}}{2}\sigma_z  $,  to  draw  out  the   time-dependent  phases  in
$\delta  V_2$.   The dimensionless  $\beta  =  {\ibra{1}\hat{\Phi_2}\iket{2}}/{\Phi_0}  $ is  the  normalized
coupling constant that can be compared across geometries.

In  Fig.~\ref{fig:fig5},  $\beta$ is  compared  between  the twin  qubit  and  a 4-JJ  flux  qubit
\cite{honigl2018} .   Irrespective of  the energies  used in the  simulations, the  twin qubit
always    has   a    local   maximum    of    coupling   strength    at   degeneracy    points
$ \Phi = n\Phi_0,  n\in\mathbb{Z} $, while the 4-JJ coupling strength goes  to zero. We have discussed
earlier the  benefits of operating  qubits near  the degeneracy points,  where there is  a low
magnetic field sensitivity to magnetic field  variations.  The twin qubit allows \iket{1}\ilra
\iket{2}  transitions  at these  optimal  working  points, while  in  other  flux qubits  this
transitions are forbidden.

  \caption{\small \textbf{Dipole  transition spectrum:} Compared are the absolute magnitudes of $\iabs{\iabs{\beta}}$
    between the twin qubit and 4-JJ qubit designs. In simulations we use $ \iunit{E_J =  91.0}{GHz}, \iunit{E_C  = 13.50}{GHz}, \iunit{\alpha  = 1.023}{},  \iunit{\eta =1.011}{} $ for the twin qubit and
    $ E_{C} = \iunit{20}{GHz}, E_J=\iunit{30}{GHz}, \alpha=0.45 $ for the 4-JJ qubit. The 4-JJ qubit has a forbidden \iket{1} \ilra \iket{2} transition, signified by a vanishing $\iabs{\beta}$ in the vicinity of degeneracy points $  \Phi =  (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_0,  n\in\mathbb{Z}  $.

% \noindent The kinetic term  $ T $ plays the role of the  dipole operator for this transition
% and  is evaluated  with  the eigenstates  \iket{1}, \iket{2}  of  the Hamiltonian.   Highest
% transition      rates     are      achieved      around      the     degeneracy      biases,
% $  \varphi_{\text{ext}} =  (2n+1)\pi,  n\in\mathbb{Z} $,  see Fig.~\ref{fig:dipole_transition}.   This
% region is thus favourable for quick state operations with external driving fields.
