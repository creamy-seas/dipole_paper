\begin{abstract}
  \noindent Short  decoherence times stand as  one of the main  obstacles hindering industrial
  scale implementation of quantum processors  based on superconducting qubits.  The simplicity
  and  flexibility   of  fabricating   superconducting  qubits   compared  with   other  qubit
  architectures, most  notably trapped ions,  has to be set  against their limited  ability of
  handling  sequential state  operations  -  the most  successful  processor  prototype has  a
  decoherence  time of  $ \sim\iunitMixed{60}{\mu}{s}  $  while the  gate operation  time is  about
  $\si\iunitMixed{20}{\mu}{s}$  \cite{linke2017}.   Therefore,  within 3  gate  operations  it's
  quantum state becomes substantially deteriorated.
  
  % Right now, in the embryonic stages of quantum infrastructure development, probability
  % theory
  % of the multi-armed bandit dictates \cite{gittins1989}: to maximize expected gains in
  % combating this decoherence problem, resources should be allocated to exploring new
  % alternatives, as opposed to exploiting the possibly sub-optimal (requiring a supporting
  % qubit overhead that is double the size of the original system) error correction mechanism
  % already in place \cite{reed2011}.
  
  In this  work we look at  increasing the qubit's decoherence  time using a new  geometry - a
  fusion of two flux qubits joined by a common Josephson Junction. At the degeneracy flux-bias
  point, $ \frac{1}{2}\Phi_0 $, the twin qubit  is measured to have energy spectrum plateaus with
  curvature  several orders  of magnitude  lower than  that in  the usual  flux qubits.   This
  flatness makes  the qubit more  robust to  flux noise. Also,  the new qubit  allows \iket{1}
  \ilra \iket{2} dipole transition, forbidden in other qubit designs.
  % , and under the most basic of fabrication cycles, the
  % qubit demonstrates a decoherence
  % time of 42\,ns.
  We experimentally study the new qubit, measure the transmission spectrum, Rabi oscillations,
  and simulate dipole transitions  of the qubit. Potentially the new  qubit may outperform the
  current mainstream design.
