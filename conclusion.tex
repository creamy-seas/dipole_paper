\section{Conclusion}
\noindent We have fabricated and characterised the first isolated twin qubit, the
distinguishing feature of which is the weak flux sensitivity in the working region of
$ \Phi = (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_0, n\in\mathbb{Z} $. Improved fabrication techniques can further advance
the qubit's decoherence time to place it in competition for the building block in quantum
electronic circuits.
