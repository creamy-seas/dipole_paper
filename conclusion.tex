\section{Conclusion}
 
 \vspace{-1em}
 
 \noindent We have fabricated and characterised the first isolated twin qubit, the distinguishing feature of which is the weak flux sensitivity in the working region of $ \Phi = (n+\frac{1}{2})\Phi_0, n\in\mathbb{Z} $. Improved fabrication techniques can further advance the qubit's decoherence time after which it could become a building block in superconducting quantum logic gates.
