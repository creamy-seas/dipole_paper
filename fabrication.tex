  \caption{\small Geometry of a twin qubit: a) Scanning electron microscope image
    of  the  qubit flux  with  phase  biases  $ \varphi  $,  $  \eta\varphi  $ applied  to  it's
    superconducting loops. The repeated line  structures are the byproduct of the
    double-angle  evaporation  of aluminum  that  creates  the Al-AlO$_x$-Al  JJs
    highlighted in red and pink. The qubit  is coupled to the microwave line with
    a T-shaped capacitor (inset); b) The  twin qubit is a symmetrical arrangement
    of  two individual  flux  qubits.  The  central junction  has  an energy  and
    capacitance  of  $ \alpha  E_{J}$,  $\alpha  C$ compared  with  the  outside values  of
    E$_J$C$_J$.}

%% Describe fabrication
\noindent The  sample is fabricated  on undoped silicon. A  coplanar transmission
line (impedance $ Z_{0} \sim 50\,\Omega $) is run to an opening between the ground planes
in  the center  of the  chip. Twin  qubits and  T-shaped capacitors  coupling the
qubits to  the transmission line  are fabricated simultaneously using  the shadow
evaporation technique  of aluminum  \cite{wu2013}. These steps  result in  a 5-JJ
structure  of  Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}.  Measurements  are  performed  in  a  14\,mK
environment  of a  dilution refrigerator  to suppress  thermal activation  of GHz
frequency transitions.  All  microwave signals probing the system  pass through a
single transmission line  that is equipped with a standard  set of attenuators on
the input  side, and  circulators and  low noise amplifiers  on the  output side.
This  facilitates power  conversion between  the laboratory  equipment and  qubit
microwaves.

Our pilot experiment did  not to go to the depths of  using chemical and physical
treatment of  the substrate  surface to  remove two-level  system defects  in the
silicon  oxide layer  \cite{earnest2018}  or employing  multi-stage shielding  to
eliminate  stray infrared  light  during  measurement \cite{barends2011}.   These
improvements will be  incorporated in the further development cycles  of the twin
qubit to build upon the demonstrated decoherence properties.
